## A word on 3rd Party Libraries
By not using 3rd party libraries in your project, you are going to learn more. Especially if it is a small projects. Unless you
specifically want to experiment with certain libs. Be aware that someone might ask: Did you write any of this code on your own
or did you just use libraries?
